# sales-prediction
My first Machine Learning app for sales prediction.
I followed https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-deploy-machine-learning-models-using-flask-b95af8fe34d4 to build this application. Here I used linear regression to predict sales value in the third month using rate of interest and sales in first two months. You have to give these these three parameters and the ML model will predict the output on the basis of dataset it is trainned on. I have already deployed this app in heroku, here is the link https://salespredictionv01.herokuapp.com/predict. See you there.
